# HeightMapPathLossPrediction
Regression of large-scale path loss parameters using deep neural networks

The VGG-16 model is used for predicting path loss exponent component(n) and shadowing factor(Ïƒ).
Trained model weights and VGG-16 model are giving in this google drive link: 
and the testing code can be found in this repo as jupyter-notebook file named as Testing_HeightMap.ipynb
